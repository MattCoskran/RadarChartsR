# RadarChartsR
In this repository is a project I made comparing premier league players from the 2021/22 season to create the best 11, or team of the season. What I did was take 3-4 
players for each position on the field and collect data on them in the form of 5 different variables based on what I felt was an important metric for that position. All
data was collected from football reference, https://fbref.com/en/. I then created data frames for the players based on position, and created a radar chart for each 
position comparing all 3-4 players at once in the same graph. The players data points were color coded to clearly see how they compared against each other in the 
categories selected for their position. Radar charts were created through the fmsb package in Rstudio.
